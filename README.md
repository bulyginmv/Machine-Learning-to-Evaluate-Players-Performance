# Analysing the 2018 World Cup Players Performances with VAEP Framework
Looking at the best and worst performances of World Cup 2018 with Value Action by Estimating Probabilities framework using XGBoost algorithm

The project was inspired by the tutorial of Jan van Haaren and Lotte Bransen on "Friends of Tracking" Youtube channel.

In this project we use XGBoost, a Machine Learning algorithm, to evaluate every action in World Cup 2018.
The action is evaluated by predicting the probability of the action leading to scoring or conceding a goal.

The results are added for each player to analyse the overall performance of the players in the games.
